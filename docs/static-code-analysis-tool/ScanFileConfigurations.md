# Overview

A `Scan.toml` file can be created to configure the behavior of the Ballerina static code analysis tool. The configuration file is picked if thereâ€™s one in the working directory.

```text
ðŸ“¦ballerina_project
 â”£ ðŸ“œ.devcontainer.json
 â”£ ðŸ“œ.gitignore
 â”£ ðŸ“œBallerina.toml
 â”£ ðŸ“œmain.bal
 â”— ðŸ“œScan.toml
```

The path to the configuration file can also be specified in the `Ballerina.toml` file as follows:

```toml
[scan]
configPath = "path/to/Scan.toml"
```

# Configuration for Platform Plugins

Users can configure platform plugins in a `Scan.toml` file by specifying the plugin JAR path to report analysis results.

```toml
[[platform]]
name = "sonarqube"
path = "path/to/sonar_platform_plugin"
```

If the `path` is not specified, the scan tool will attempt to download the Platform Plugins developed by the Ballerina team.

```toml
[[platform]]
name = "sonarqube"
```

Users can also provide additional arguments to the platform plugin by specifying them in the `Scan.toml` file.

```toml
[[platform]]
name = "sonarqube"
path = "path/to/sonar_platform_plugin"
sonarProjectPropertiesPath = "sonar-project.properties"
```

# Configuration for Static Code Analyzer Plugins

Users can configure static code analyzer plugins in a `Scan.toml` file. These plugins are automatically added as imports by a code generator during scans, ensuring they are only engaged during a `bal scan`.

```toml
[[analyzer]]
org = "org1"
name = "name1"
```

For locally available static code analyzer plugins, the following configuration can be used:

```toml
[[analyzer]]
org = "org2"
name = "name2"
version = "version"
repository = "local"
```

# Configuration for Static Code Analyzer Rules

Users can specify the rules to filter out specific issues during an analysis by defining them in a `Scan.toml` file.

Define the rules to include in the analysis:

```toml
[rules]
include = ["ballerina:101", "ballerina/io:101"]
```

Define the rules to exclude in the analysis:

```toml
[rules]
exclude = ["ballerina:101", "ballerina/io:101"]
```
