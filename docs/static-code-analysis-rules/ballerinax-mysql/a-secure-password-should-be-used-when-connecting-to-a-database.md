# Rule definition

- Rule Title: `A secure password should be used when connecting to a database`
- Rule ID: `undefined`
- Rule Kind: `CODE_SMELL`
- Affecting Modules: `['Ballerinax/mysql']`

### Why is this an issue?

When a database lacks authentication requirements, it opens the door for unrestricted access and manipulation of its stored data. Exploiting this vulnerability usually involves identifying the target database and establishing a connection to it without the necessity of any authentication credentials.

### Non-compliant Code Example:

```ballerina
configurable string user = ?;
configurable string host = ?;
configurable int port = ?;
configurable string database = ?;

public function connectToDatabase() {
    mysql:Client|error dbClient = new (host = host,
        user = user,
        password = "", // Noncompliant
        port = port,
        database = database
    );
    
    // ...
}
```

### The solution can be to:

- Using a robust password sourced from configurations. The 'passwordâ€™' property is configured in a configuration file during deployment, and its value should be both strong and unique for each database.

```ballerina
configurable string user = ?;
configurable string password = ?; // Compliant
configurable string host = ?;
configurable int port = ?;
configurable string database = ?;

public function connectToDatabase() {
    mysql:Client|error dbClient = new (host = host,
        user = user,
        password = password, // Compliant
        port = port,
        database = database
    );

    // ...
}
```
